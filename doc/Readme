This directory contains documents on how to use Murphi Release 3.1.

A good place to start is the overview paper of Murphi (DDHY92.ps) and, of
course, the user manual. We are currently working on a web tutorial for
Murphi. Check our web page at
  http://sprout.stanford.edu/dill/murphi.html
to see if it is finished yet. Please consult the papers for background 
information as needed.
